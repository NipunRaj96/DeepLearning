# 🧠 Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository — a personal space documenting my journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks.

This repository is a collection of my individual deep learning projects, where I explore the core concepts of:

- **Neural Networks**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**ndincownvwdbv[qwe

Each project represents a milestone in my learning path, helping me strengthen both my theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Building foundational deep learning models using **Python**
- Working with libraries like **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **SciKit** and **Matplotlib**
- Training, evaluating, and improving models with real-world datasets

## 📁 Where to Find Projects

All projects are hosted in their own dedicated repositories for better clarity and organisation. This repo serves as the hub for my deep learning exploration.
