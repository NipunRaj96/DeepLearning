# 🧠 Deep Learning Journey

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository — a personal space documenting my journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence , Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing.

This repository is a collection of my individual deep learning journey, where I explore the core concepts of: 

- **Neural Networks**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  
---

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Building foundational deep learning models using **Python**
- Working with libraries like **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **SciKit** and **Matplotlib**
- Training, evaluating, and improving models with real-world datasets
